# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript related to DOM manipulation. The JavaScript uses `getElementById` and `getElementsByTagName` in a way that might not always work as intended, leading to unexpected behavior and silent failures. The solution provides the correct and more robust approaches.

## Bug
The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code. The script attempts to hide a div and change the color of the first div element.  However, if the div with the ID 'myDiv' is not found or any other unexpected scenario occurs, the code might not produce the desired results without any explicit error.  The `getElementsByTagName` approach can be troublesome if multiple elements with the tag exist, as the code doesn't handle this explicitly.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the corrected code. It uses more robust and explicit methods for DOM manipulation, handling potential errors and inconsistencies.
